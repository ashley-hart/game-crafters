'176' (░) - Used for biome 11 (ice/snow terrain)
'177' (▒) - Used for biome 12 (more ice/snow terrain)
'178' (▓) - Used for biome 13 (dense ice/snow terrain)
'139' (‹) - Used for biome 16 (another forest type)
'o' - Used for rivers (overrides any other terrain character)

The colors are also defined in the ColorDictionary method in the same function:

Water: Blue (13, 103, 196)
Dark green: Forest (68, 158, 53)
Light green: Grassland (131, 212, 82)
Desert: Yellow (255, 218, 90)

These characters and colors work together to create a visual representation of the world generated by the simulation.
